TODO:
    GENERAL:

    ASTRA:
        -Improve SNR calculation using SkyFit2 functions   
            -If does not improve star masking issues, bridge gaps with kalman
        -Use LaTeX for titles
        -Hover-over parameter descriptions
        -Add flexibility for multiple manual picks, generally make more robust.
        -remove load points button, make auto when selecting ECSV
        -run computeintensitysum() etc after running ASTRA/Kalman
        -Look into correcting photometry pixels post-kalman filter
    KALMAN:
        -Remove accelration option in GUI
        -Use median residuals from accel model to create measurement cov. matrix
        -Expose process cov matrix in GUI, default 0.1
    PIPELINE:
        -look into replaceing SNR rejection with model residuals and SNR mix
