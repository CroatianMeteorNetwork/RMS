TODO:
    GENERAL:
        -Put sidebar button to open Astra
        -Add option to save ASTRA animation
    ASTRA:
        -Improve SNR calculation using SkyFit2 functions   
            -If does not improve star masking issues, bridge gaps with kalman
        -run computeintensitysum() etc after running ASTRA/Kalman
        -Look into correcting photometry pixels post-kalman filter
    KALMAN:

    PIPELINE:
        -look into replaceing SNR rejection with model residuals and SNR mix


NOTE:
    -in future versions ASTRA can be configued to run multiple passes to improve quality in low-pick events
    -getting warnings during ani saving that matplotlib will likely fail out of thread, no errors encountered though.
