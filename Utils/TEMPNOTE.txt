Changes before merge:
    -Implement modular (if name is main) utiliztion into ASTRA
    -Add guide.md for ASTRA in guides (Also document future improvements, and how future improvements should be implemented)

    -Look into solving length over-estimation in low-SNR frames
        -Add penalty function of STD of photometric area?
    -Investigate photometry and SNR calculatiosn to ensure it is correct 
        -SNR especially seems to be off


    -Make ASTRA state changing, and add access functions
    -Change ASTRA to only load relevant frames and dump stack after (save memory)
    -Change CE_coeff to simpler method (leading edge, center, custom)
