    -Change all class vars to be instantiated at the init of PlateTool()
        -Also adjust their later defs. & utilizations to reflect this
    -Change Avepixel to use the median value rather than mean
    -Investigate photometry and SNR calculatiosn to ensure it is correct 
        -SNR especially seems to be off
    -Add values utilized in Mag/SNR calculations in SaveAni
    -Implement modular (if name is main) utiliztion into ASTRA
    -Structure all imports in order of native -> imported -> internal
    -Break all lines beyond 110 charecters to maintain readibility
    -Include & Update all docstrings into ASTRA and ASTRA GUI
    -Add guide.md for ASTRA in guides (Also document future improvements, and how future improvements should be implemented)
    -Make Kalman functions in ASTRA standalone
    -Put ASTRA_GUI into SkyFit2 file
    -Look into solving length over-estimation in low-SNR frames
        -Add penalty function of STD of photometric area?
