Changes before merge:
    -Implement modular (if name is main) utiliztion into ASTRA
    -Structure all imports in order of native -> imported -> internal
    -Add guide.md for ASTRA in guides (Also document future improvements, and how future improvements should be implemented)
    -Make Kalman functions in ASTRA standalone
    -Put ASTRA_GUI into SkyFit2 file

    -Look into solving length over-estimation in low-SNR frames
        -Add penalty function of STD of photometric area?
    -Investigate photometry and SNR calculatiosn to ensure it is correct 
        -SNR especially seems to be off
