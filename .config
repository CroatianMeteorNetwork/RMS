; Media Backend: options are gst, cv2, or v4l2.
;
; The preferred option is 'gst', which corresponds to GStreamer Standalone. This method bypass OpenCV,
; and provides the highest timestamps accuracy.
; For the OpenCV method, choose 'cv2', this will revert to the OpenCV method which has proven to be
; stable but has poor timestamping performance. 
; To force OpenCV to use v4l2, choose 'v4l2', this will attempt to use v4l2 hardware acceleration
; with OpenCV (also has poor timestamping performance compared to gst.) 
; If gst, or v4l2 fails, the code reverts to cv2.
; If media_backend is not set, the code will first attempt to use GStreamer Direct, them OpenCV

; Camera Latency Settings for GStreamer Timestamps:
;
; The following two parameters correct for camera latency when in GStreamer Standalone mode.
; The settings are ignore when using other media_backend methods.

; For example:
;

;     camera_buffer = 1
;     camera_latency = 0.05
;
; If timestamps are late, increase latency. If early, decrease latency.
; Formula is:
; corrected_timestamp = timestamp - camera_buffer / fps - total_latency

; -----------
; By default, RMS will upload text files with meteor and star detections, secondary data products 
;     such as calibration plots, all FF image files, and all FR files with raw fireball frames.
;     This typically results in an archive of 100-500 MB in size. Some stations have limited 
;     data or bad internet connections, so a reduced data set can be uploaded to the server.
; Options:
;     1 - Normal mode. Everything is uploaded, including FF files with detections.
;     2 - Skip FFs. Everything except two FF files will be uploaded. One with the most matched stars
;         and another random one with a meteor detection.
;     3 - Skip FFs and FRs. Same as option 2, but FR files will also be skipped.
