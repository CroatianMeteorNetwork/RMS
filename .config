; IMPORTANT: Unlike other RMS files, the '.config' file is never automatically
; updated. When changes are introduced to the config file in RMS, these changes
; will NOT be automatically reflected in the active '.config' file on 
; individual machines. Users should manually update their '.config' file if 
; changing any option from its default value is desired, or to simply stay 
; up-to-date. If an option is missing from the config file, a default value 
; will be automatically applied.
; An up-to-date template config '.configTemplate' file, containing the current

;               camera_latency: 0.05
; If timestamps are late, increase latency. If early, decrease latency.
; Formula is:
; corrected_timestamp = timestamp - camera_buffer / fps - total_latency
