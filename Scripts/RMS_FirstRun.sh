echo "Hey, welcome to the Raspberry Pi Meteor Station (RMS) project!

This guide will help you to get your system up and running in no time!


IMPORTANT! Before you proceed make sure you have the following:

 1. Geo location of your camera (latitude +N, longitude +E, elevation).
   The latitude and longitude should be in degrees to at least 5 decimal
   places. Be careful that the longitude of places in the western hemisphere
   is negative. E.g. if your camera was installed on the Statue of Libery,
   the latitude would be 40.689298 and the longitude would be -74.044479.
   The elevation should be given in meters (NOT feet!) and in the mean sea level
   (MSL) convention (not WGS84).
   The easiest way to measure the coordinates is in Google Earth. Make sure to
   pinpoint the actual location of the camera to within a precision of at least
   10 meters.

 2. Unique station code. To obtain a station code, send an e-mail containing
    the following to Denis Vida ($RMSEMAIL):
      a) Geo coordinates from step 1.
      b) Your country.
      c) Brief description of the camera system (location, owner's name),
         e.g. Mike Henderson's camera in London, Ontario, Canada.

    You will then be given a unique station code which will look something
    like this: US01AB. The first two letters is the ISO code of the country,
    and the last 4 characters are the unique alphanumeric identifier.

IMPORTANT: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE BEFORE CONTINUING!
